# MAP - A Math Advancement Platform

## About
This project is for the CS500 class at Western Kentucky University under the direction of Dr. Zhonghang Xia. Currently, most platforms, such as Khan Academy, use question banks. Although their banks are massive, they are missing one key aspect to problem solving, the randomness and unexpectiveness that life brings. There will always be some problem missing,
regardless of its importance. Textbook questions are also limited. Not only is there a limited number of questions, but most of the time, most of the questions don't have any work on how to solve the questions, only the answer, if that. For this reason, auto-generating questions is highly sought after. Questions autogenered allow users to experience infinite possibilities and, if correctly developed, can be customized to fit the user in ways that question banks can not achieve. This project is the development of such a platform, MAP. MAP is a mathematic
question generator that allows students to solve problem sets and scales to the need of the student. The platform also gives students a complete solution with steps. In the future, I would like the project to scan handwritten solutions to analyse students' work and give feedback directly.

## Notice
Some lines of code have been generated using generative AI, mainly Oracle's ChatGPT (GPT 4 Turbo). Any lines that have been generated have been commented as such.

## Progress
Currently, I am working on developing the AI side of the project, scaling questions with the student's performance.
